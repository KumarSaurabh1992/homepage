	<h2>  Asynchronus Finite Difference for Advection-Diffusion Equation</h2></a>
     <div id="collapse1" class="collapse out">
          <p> <b> Conference Paper </b> : Kumar Saurabh, "Implementation of Asynchronous Scheme on 
          Parallel Frameworks using MPI." in  18<sup>th</sup> AeSI Annual CFD Symposium. <a target="_blank" href = http://www.nal.res.in/cfdsympo/CFD_FullPapers_Final_18/Implementation%20of%20Asynchronous%20Scheme%20.pdf> Link </a> </p>
         
         <p> This work was a part of Master Thesis. The thesis and presentations can be found <a target="_blank" href = https://github.com/KumarSaurabh1992/Asynchronous-Finite-Difference-for-PDEs> here </a></p>
         
          <p> The numerical solution of partial differential equations in large-scale 
          problems requires the usage of parallel computing. In this context, the 
          computational domain is often split into smaller sub-domains that are handled 
          by separate processors. Due to the non-local nature of the underlying problem, 
          communication as well as synchronization between these processing elements (PEs) 
          is required. Finite Difference is one of such techniques to solve the PDEs. 
          Since the discretization by finite- difference schemes results in mostly simple 
          arithmetic operations, the overhead due to communication and synchronization 
          might become a bottleneck. Current trends in massively parallel computing systems
          suggest that the number of processors will continue to grow over time, which in 
          turn, increases the overhead associated with communication and synchronization. 
          Simulation at extreme levels of parallelism will then require an elimination, 
          or at least a tight control of these overheads. While stability is conserved when
          these schemes are used asynchronously, accuracy is greatly degraded. Message 
          arrivals at PEs are essentially random processes, so is the behavior of the error. 
          Within a statistical framework the average errors drop always to first-order 
          regardless of the statistics of delay.</p>
          
          <p>The Asynchrony Tolerant (AT) scheme proposed by Donzis &amp; Aditya <sup>1</sup> and 
          Mudigree et. al.<sup>2</sup> are capable of maintaining the order of accuracy even in presence of 
          delays and robust the asynchrony. A rigorous analysis of these scheme is 
          performed. However, in all of these scheme the error increases with the 
          increase in the delay. The two MPI communication technique, namely MPI 
     		 Send/Recv and MPI Put/Get is compared for the statistics of delay. Further, 
     		 the effect of distributing the work across various nodes is investigated. </p>
     		 
     		 <h2> Key Findings</h2>
            <ul class="main-list">
                <li>MPI_Put/Get outperforms MPI_Send/Recv in delay statistics. 
                This can be explained due to the fact that there is buffering of data in 
                MPI_SendRecv while in the case of MPI_Put/Get one processor writes directly
                in the window created by the another processor. Thus for the Asynchronous 
                operation, MPI_Put/Get is preferred.  </li>
                <li> The communication among the processor within the same node 
                requires less time than communicating across the nodes. Thus, it should 
                be expected that the distribution of processor across the node would take 
                more time. But for a job requiring large Cache Size, this is not the case. 
                This can be explained by the fact that distributing the processor across 
                the nodes gives access to more RAM, which in turn reduces the number of Cache 
                Miss and Hit. </li>
